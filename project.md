# The Promort Application

The goal of the ProMort Image Management System is to conduct a large scale epidemiological study of patients that have been diagnosed with a benign form of prostatic cancer but nevertheless died before expected.

The specific goal of the ProMort IMS is to create a collection of fully annotated images related to biopsies slides.

The system consists of two main parts: 

- the **ROIs annotation** phase, where users draw ROIs and take measures on the images;
- the **Clinical annotation** phase, where users perform the clinical review on each ROIs.
 
Users may belong to one or both these possible groups: *ROIs Reviewers* and *Clinical Reviwers*. *ROIs Reviewers* can perform both the **ROIs** and the **Clinical annotation** phases, while *Clinical Reviewers* can work only on the **Clinical annotation**. 

The system keeps the anonymity of each case and the blindness between users through the application of a unique anonymised label to each review step different for each reviewer.  

# About this tutorial

This guide briefly explains the usage of the ProMort Application, that is quite the same for all the users. Any variations in the application behaviour for the different type of users are highlighted using a code color (<span style="color:red">ROIs Reviewers</span> and <span style="color:blue">Clinical  Reviewers</span>).
