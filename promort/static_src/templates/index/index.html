                        This is an open label, non-inferiority trial, comparing <strong>GAF (Glyoxal Acid-Free)
                        Fixative</strong> VS Formalin as a fixative for histological specimens obtained from
                        surgical biopsies which are most frequently performed for diagnostic purposes (e.g.: breast,
                        prostate, colon, endometrium and lung).

                        The objectives of the proposed study is to confirm, in a large sample of histological specimens
                        obtained from different tissues, that an acid-free from of glyoxal (GAF) represents a novel
                        tissue fixative by investigating morphological preservation and diagnostic value to be
                        established on the basis of cellular details and of expression of immunohistochemical markers.
